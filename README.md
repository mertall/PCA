# PCA

```bash
python PCA.py
```
```bash
Choose the number of rows in your sparse random matrix:
```
Please enter an integer and the program will procede to give you your singular value matrix and a 3D graph and scatterplot of the singular vectors. 

# Future Work
PCA.py will be expanded to allow for higher dimension visualization(1000x8 matrix). Example of higher dimension visualization is below. Thanks for checking this page out! Please leave suggestions.
